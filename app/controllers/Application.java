	 * edited. This is done through the ORM, checking if there are any
	 * items with a matching approval key. If so, it is checked if they
	 * have been approved yet. If not, it is then to approved, and the 
	 * record is updated. The flash message is set to "Your question/
	 * answer has been approved", and they are redirected to view the
	 * item. Otherwise, they are just redirected to the item.

	 The router then handles passing this to the approval function.
